# 1 - Project

<h3> askMe was my first project that I did when I started learning nodejs. </h3>

A small question and answer platform where users can post their questions and other users can contribute by answering the posted questions.
It's a small project that served as a start for me to learn the concepts of EJS and how to work with partials.

It was my first contact with MySql and sequelize. I learned how to connect to the database, how to create tables and how to access the data in the database. :D
